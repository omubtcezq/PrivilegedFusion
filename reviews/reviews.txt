Three review reports are received. The authors are
suggested to look into the review comments carefully and
improve the paper by taking advantage of the reviewers'
suggestions.

Comments to the author
#=====================================#

This paper provides a novel method by adding correlated
noise at different sensors to restrict the performance
gained from fusing additional measurements while
guaranteeing better performance to those that can remove
it. This idea is interesting and the paper is well-written.
The reviewer has no other comments.

Reviewer 2 of CDC 2022 submission 255
Comments to the author
#=====================================#

This work presents a privileged estimate fusion with
correlated gaussian keystreams. The considered problem is
not new, and many estimator designs have been reported in
the literature. Below are some of my concerns.
1 The motivation of the work on the estimator design can be
further strengthened. Some related works were presented in
“Privacy-Preserving Distributed Optimization via Subspace
Perturbation: A General Framework” and “Preserving
Data-Privacy With Added Noises: Optimal Estimation and
Privacy Analysis”. Please discuss differences between these
references, especially for the simulation results.
2 A practical example is suggested to convincingly verify
the effectiveness of the control method.
3 What are the physical units of the variables of the
simulated system in simulations?

Comments to the author
#=====================================#

This paper extended the work in ref. [16] (same authors) to
the related distributed estimation task. 
Here are some minor comments:
1. The concepts of “Performance Loss Lower Bound” and
“Performance Gain Upper Bound” are not very clear to me.
2. Since this work is based on your own previous study,
which is ref. [16], we would pay more attention to its
effectiveness and practicality. Using a real system for
simulation could be more convincing.

Similarity scores and scan reports are generated by an external
provider (iThenticate) and not by the conference.

The scan reports are stored on the iThenticate servers and not
downloaded to the conference submission system servers. Eventually the
reports are deleted from the iThenticate servers at a time determined
by conference and provider policy, after which they are no longer
available.

Please check the on-line report to understand how the similarity score
was determined and which sections of your paper may need changes.

The score and report are provided to assist you in revising your
manuscript, if necessary.

The conference will not be able to provide you a score or a report for
the revised manuscript.
